# Project on Reinforcement Learning (Course project MLDL 2025 - POLITO)
### Teaching assistants: Andrea Protopapa and Davide Buoso

This work explores the sim‑to‑real transfer in robotic control using Reinforcement Learning techniques via Domain Randomization and Visual-Based inputs on the MuJoco Hopper environment.

The following methods are implemented:
- REINFORCE 
- Actor-Critic 
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Uniform Domain Randomization
- Visual-Based Reinforcement Learning (visual-only approach, multi-modal approach, distillation)

### Project structure
The project contains the following folders:

`env`: it contains `custom_hommer.py` about the Hopper environment

`reinforce`: 

`actor_critic`:

`ppo`:

`visual_rl`:
